To render terrain in 3D, you need a triangular mesh — a set of 3D triangles 
representing the surface. The easiest way to get one from height data is a uniform 
grid (two triangles per pixel), but that's a lot of triangles. For fast rendering, 
we want to reduce this amount by adapting the mesh to the surface — using bigger 
triangles in relatively smooth areas, and smaller ones where there's a lot
